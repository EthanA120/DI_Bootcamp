# TASK:
"""
    Air management system
    Your goal is to build an airplanes traffic management system.
    Your program should rely on four classes: Company, Airplane, Flight and Airport.
    Consider every plane can fly only once per day.

    Here is a description of those classes:
    0. Company
    Attributes:
        - id (str) A two letters code
        - name (str)
        - planes (List of Plane) Every plane that belong to this airlines


    1) Airplane
    Attributes:
        - id (int)
        - current_location (Airport)
        - company (Company) The airlines
        - next_flights (List of Flight) Every future flight of the airplane, this list should always be sorted by datetime.

    Methods:
        - fly(self, destination)
        - location_on_date(self, date) Returns where the plane will be on this date
        - available_on_date(self, date, location) Returns True if the plane can fly from this location on this date
            (it can fly if it is in this location on this date and if it doesnâ€™t already have a flight planned).


    2) Flight
    Attributes:
        - date (datetime.Date)
        - destination (Airport) The destination airport.
        - origine (Airport) The origine airport.
        - plane (Plane)
        - id (str) The ID is an encoded string composed of the destination, the airlines code and the date.

    Methods
    (Those methods are here only to update the rest of the system,
        for example, to change the location of the plane when he arrives):
        - take_off(self)
        - land(self)


    3) Airport
    Attributes:
        - city (str) The code of the city where the airport is
        - planes (List of Airplane) A list of every plane that is currently in this airport
        - scheduled_departures (List of Flight) Every future flight from this airport, sorted by date
        - scheduled_arrivals (List of Flight) Every future arrival to this airport, sorted by date

    Methods:
        - schedule_flight(self, destination, datetime) This method finds when an available airplane from an airline
            that serve the origine and the destination and schedule a flight for it.
        - info(self, start_date, end_date) Display every scheduled flight from start_date to end_date.


    You are free to add any class/method/attribute to your code, be sure to document everything you write.
    Write a small code to test your program.
