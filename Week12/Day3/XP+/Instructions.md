### Exercise 1: Bootcamp

For this exercise, you will have to find some requests on your own!

### Create

1. Create a database called bootcamp.
2. Create a table called students.
3. Add the following columns:
    1. id
    2. last_name
    3. first_name
    4. birth_date</br>
       **The id must be auto_incremented.**</br>
       Make sure to choose the correct data type for each column.</br>
       To help, here is the data that you will have to insert. (How do we insert a date to a table?)


Here is the data:
<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>id</th>
        <th>first_name</th>
        <th>last_name</th>
        <th>birth_date</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>Marc</td>
        <td>Benichou</td>
        <td>02/11/1998</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>Yoan</td>
        <td>Cohen</td>
        <td>03/12/2010</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>Lea</td>
        <td>Benichou</td>
        <td>27/07/1987</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>Amelia</td>
        <td>Dux</td>
        <td>07/04/1996</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>David</td>
        <td>Grez</td>
        <td>14/06/2003</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>Omer</td>
        <td>Simpson</td>
        <td>03/10/1980</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
