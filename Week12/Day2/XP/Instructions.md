###Part I: Secret Key

Use python to create a random secret key composed of 256 random letters.


###Part II: Create the form

1. Let’s create the structure of our website.
    1. Add an app.py file.
    2. Add a templates folder where we will have all our templates.
    3. Add a routes.py file.
    

2. Create an forms.py page, that contains an AddCity form with the following fields:
    - city’s name
    - city’s country
    - number of inhabitants
    - city’s area (in square km)


Have in mind you must have a view, route and a template, where a user can add a city to your website.

3. Add a validator to these fields to make them required fields
   - city’s name
   - city’s country
   - number of inhabitants


###Part III : Validators

Add a validator so the city’s name won’t contain more than 15 letters.
