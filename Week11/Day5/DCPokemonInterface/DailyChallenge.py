        Instructions:
        Use the Pokemon API to create a Pokemons flask interface.
        If you have some trouble working with an API look at the Hint below.

        Create a website with the following pages:

            1. Pokemon page (/pokemon/<id>)
                This page displays some information about a pokemon (at least a picture and a name)

            2. By Type (pokemons/bytype/<type>)
                Displays a list of all the pokemons of a given type.

            3. By name (/pokemons/byname/<name>)
                Redirects to the page of this pokemon if it exists, else redirect to the main page.

            4. Main page (/)
                The main page should contain a list of all the pokemons types, each type is clickable and lead to the corresponding bytype page.

            5. All pokemons (/pokemons/all) This page displays a list of all the existing pokemons, this list is a
                bit too large, try to add a pagination feature so that you only display 20 pokemons by page (Hint: play
                with the limit and offset parameters).

        Notes : All the pokemons in the /pokemons/bytype, /pokemons/all and / should be displayed as frames that
            contains a picture of the pokemon and his name. When clicked, this frame leads to the pokemonâ€™s page.

        Good luck.
        Make it pretty!


        Hint:
            If you struggle with the API:
            Every endpoint can be used in two ways, for example:
                - the /pokemon/ can be used to retrieve a list of all the pokemons if nothing comes after the second /
                - the /pokemon/ can be used to retrieve a specific pokemon by specifying its id or its name after the second /, for example: /pokemon/1 (by id) or /pokemon/ditto (by name)
